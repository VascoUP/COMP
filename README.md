# COMP

A tool able to read a list of regular expressions (a possibility is to use the PCRE (http://www.pcre.org/) format) and to build correspondent automata (e-NFA, NFA, DFA, etc.). The tool should be able to transform automata, minimize the DFA, and to generate Java and/or C code to implement the automata.
